# Northeastern Applied AI Lab

Welcome to the **Northeastern Applied AI Lab** â€” where innovation meets real-world impact.

The Northeastern Applied AI Lab is dedicated to advancing the practical application of artificial intelligence across industries. Our mission is to bridge the gap between cutting-edge AI research and its deployment in real-world systems, solving complex problems in areas such as healthcare, finance, education, and enterprise operations.

## What We Focus On

We conduct applied research and develop deployable solutions across several critical AI domains:

- **Generative AI (Gen-AI):**
  - Large Language Models (LLMs)
  - Diffusion models
  - Multi-modal generation

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):**
  - Document understanding
  - Information extraction
  - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
  - Conversational AI

- **Classical Machine Learning:**
  - Predictive modeling
  - Anomaly detection
  - Time series analysis
  - Statistical learning

## What We Offer

- **Hands-on Projects:** Students work on real-world, industry-relevant AI problems.
- **Mentorship:** Close collaboration with faculty, AI researchers, and industry partners.
- **Cloud Resources:** Full access to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) resources through academic grants.
- **Publication and Presentation Opportunities:** Participate in conferences, workshops, and Northeastern showcases.
- **Startup Incubation Support:** For students who wish to turn their research into startups.
